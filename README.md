# Spammit
Text spammer

Spammit is a simple program fully written in python.

It spams a peice of text on the cursor location. It uses a python module called "PyAutoGUI" that has the ability to 
use your device's keyboard just like a normal human being. Amazing isn't it? ^_^

Note: Incase the text that you input has many characters, the program tends to glitch incase its not able to 
type the text within the time limit that you specified. So choose the time limit wisely!

pip3 install pyautogui
